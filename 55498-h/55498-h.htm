<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">During</span> the last year I have more than
once been told that an authoritative biographical
sketch of my husband ought to
be written and I have never felt inclined to
dispute the statement as an abstract proposition.
But when it is followed by the direct
question: “Who so capable of writing
it as you?” the names of one or two of his
personal friends inevitably present themselves
as belonging to practised writers and
connoisseurs of art, who might, perhaps,
need the aid of dates or facts I could supply,
but who, in more essential respects,
would be altogether better equipped for the
task. Homer Martin was so intensely masculine,
so preëminently a man’s man, that
he must necessarily have escaped thorough
comprehension by any woman. And this,
I think, is the chief reason why I have so
long delayed, why I am even now inclined
to shirk altogether, the fulfilment of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
reluctant promise to put on paper some of
my memories of the years we spent together.</p>

<p>The question made me smile when it was
propounded more than a year ago, but
since then it has often made me ponder.
Doubtless no one else has had so long and
intimate an acquaintance with various
phases of his character and circumstances;
doubtless, too, it was not merely as an artist
that he commanded attention and attracted
life-long friends. Yet I suppose
it must be solely in this character that he
appeals to the majority of those who are
now attaining to a tardy appreciation of his
achievement as a whole. It is not in my
power to hasten that. When I first met
him my ignorance of art—at any rate on its
pictorial side—was dense; and if it has
been somewhat mitigated since, that result
is due solely to him and largely to his own
works. Is not this tantamount to expressing
my conviction that those who wish to
increase their knowledge of Homer Martin
as an artist can do so much more satisfactorily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
by studying the landscapes into
which he has put as much of his best self
as any man could part with and live, than
by reading anything I find it possible to
say about him? Aspects of external nature
are inextricably blended in these with the
mind, moods, and personality of the painter.
Years before he had quite succeeded in mastering
his material, I remember the late
John Richard Dennett saying of them:
“Martin’s landscapes look as if no one but
God and himself had ever seen the places.”
There is an austerity, a remoteness, a certain
savagery in even the sunniest and most
peaceful of them, which were also in him,
and an instinctive perception of which had
made me say to him in the very earliest days
of our acquaintance that he reminded me of
Ishmael. They formed, I think, the substratum
of his personality. Needless to
add, for those who knew him even slightly,
that he had other phases. Though the
human verb in him was one and singular,
its moods were many.</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="smcap">Homer Dodge Martin</span>,
fourth child and youngest son
of Homer Martin and Sarah
Dodge, was born in Albany,
N. Y., in a house on Park Street, October
28, 1836. That was my own native city, but
although we must have lived for years in
the same neighborhood, he was past twenty-two
and I in my twenty-first year when we
first became acquainted. But for the anti-slavery
movement which split the Methodist
body first into two great sections and
then into minor subdivisions, we might have
met much earlier, for, in our childhood, our
parents had attended the same place of
worship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>What I know, therefore, about his early
years I learned chiefly from his mother.
He was not of a reminiscent habit as a rule,
and his recollections of childhood were not
always pleasant. His father was one of
the most upright and altogether the mildest-tempered
of all the men that I have
met. His mother was a woman of strong
but uncultivated mind, keen wit, incisive
speech and arbitrary will, from whom her
son derived many of his own characteristics,
including his innate bent toward pictorial
expression. In her that inclination never
took any but the crudest shape, but
she had beyond all peradventure the instinct
which under more propitious circumstances
would have displayed itself more
convincingly. Perhaps the very cramping
of it in her was the cause of its appearance
at so preternaturally early an age in him.
She more than once told me that he began
to draw as soon as he could hold a pencil,
and that from his twentieth month to
provide him with one and a piece of blank
paper was the surest means of quieting his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
most turbulent outbreaks. Years afterward,
not long before our marriage, his
first schoolmistress sent me a spirited drawing
of a horse which she said he had made
for her when not more than five years old.</p>

<p>This drawing was produced in one of the
Albany ward schools, and it pretty accurately
foreshadowed all that he was to accomplish
in them thereafter. I doubt if he
ever took kindly to lessons obviously given.
Even in painting, his sole direct tuition was
imparted by James Hart and extended over
two weeks only. What he needed, what
suited him, he then and always took in, so
to say, through his pores, absorbing what
he required, leaving other things untouched,
and wrestling unaided with his personal
problems. Greatly to his own after
regret, his ordinary schooling ended when
he was thirteen. But at the time his aversion
to school-books and school routine dovetailed
to a marvel with the persuasion of his
relatives that it was time for him to begin
earning his own livelihood. He once told
me that his school-hours had been largely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
spent in looking through the windows at
the Greenbush hills on the other side of the
Hudson, and in longing for the time to
come when he could go over there in the
horse-boat with paper and pencil to record
a nearer view.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it was only for school-books
as such that he had an intimate aversion.
In other lines all was fish that came to his
net. How he obtained it I do not know,
but a copy of Volney’s “Ruins” which he
read at this period colored his opinions in a
way that he afterward found reason to
regret. But at the time it made him an
irreverent, amused, and precocious critic of
the talk he heard at Conference-time, when
itinerant ministers thronged the family
board.</p>

</div>

<p>Poetry of certain kinds attracted him
throughout his life, and verse that greatly
pleased him would stamp itself indelibly
on his memory. Once in a great while,
almost to the last, I could persuade him to
repeat to me Keats’s “Ode on a Grecian
Urn,” with a lingering enunciation and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
melancholy charm of accent which a few of
his most intimate friends may likewise recall.
I especially remember one night in
Villerville, when we were alone out-of-doors
in the late moonlight, awaiting in vain the
advent of a nightingale said to have been
heard in the neighborhood, that he more
than compensated me for its absence by
reciting the whole of the same poet’s lines
to that “light-wingèd Dryad of the trees.”
Reciting, I say, but the word is ill chosen.
It was rather a barely audible yet perfectly
distinct breathing out of the ineffable melancholy
and remoteness of those perfect
lines.</p>

<p>Homer was transferred to his father’s
carpenter shop on leaving school; but even
that most patient of men came at last
to the reluctant conclusion that the long,
slender fingers which could not refrain
from ornamenting smoothly planed boards
with irrelevant trees and mountains were of
no use at all in handling saws and chisels.
A shopkeeper with whom he was next
placed as clerk, much against the boy’s own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
will, soon discharged him for incorrigible—perhaps
premeditated—rudeness to customers.
One of these, who was a young
cleric in the Episcopalian Seminary in
Ninth Avenue, New York City, when he
told me the story, described in words too
graphic to quote, the manner in which, as
a child, he had once been driven out of
the shop and all memory of what he was
sent for out of his mind, by the thunderous
scowl and wrath-freighted tone and
terms in which Homer inquired what he
wanted.</p>

<p>He was next introduced into the architect’s
office of a relative, whence he was
eliminated, partly because his cousin
thought the inevitable landscapes that decorated
his plans totally superfluous, but
also on account of Homer’s congenital inability
to see perpendicular lines distinctly.
I think I never saw him draw an upright
of any sort without first laying his paper
or canvas on its side. When the Civil War
broke out, shortly before our marriage, and
he presented himself for the draft, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
this defect of vision which caused the examiners
to reject him.</p>

<p>Every attempt at harnessing him to a
beaten track of obvious utility and present
productiveness having terminated disastrously,
from the paternal point of view,
E. D. Palmer, the Albany sculptor, finally
succeeded in persuading the elder Homer
Martin that his son’s talent and inclination
for art were too marked and exclusive to
permit of his success in any other pursuit.
Thenceforward—he was perhaps sixteen—he
was left free to follow the bent of his
genius. I do not know where he painted at
first; perhaps at home. Later on, he had a
studio in the old Museum Building, at the
junction of State Street and Broadway.
James Hart had previously occupied it, and
it was probably there that for a fortnight
he acted as Homer’s instructor.</p>

<p>There were other painters in Albany at
the time: William Hart, George Boughton,
Edward Gay, perhaps one or two others,
with all of whom he was intimate and whose
studios he frequented. Boughton went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
abroad not long after, and, when he was in
France, once wrote to Launt Thompson in
most enthusiastic terms concerning the
landscapes of Corot, whose great vogue
had hardly yet begun, but with whose work
Boughton was at once enchanted. And, in
describing it, he remarked that “if Homer
Martin had been his pupil he could hardly
paint more like him.” It was not until long
years after that Thompson had the grace to
repeat the observation to Homer, and when
at last he did so, the only reply he got was:
“Why did you not tell me that years ago,
when it would have been of some service
to me?” For Homer, too, was one of the
Corot worshipers from the first.</p>

<p>It was in the Museum studio that I first
saw Homer Martin. It was not until long
afterward that I learned—and not from
him—that having seen me in the street, he
deliberately sought acquaintance with my
eldest brother, like himself a lover of music
and a frequenter of the local Philharmonic
Society. An invitation to visit the studio
and bring his sisters soon followed. To the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
end of his days, I suppose, Homer had
reticences of that sort with me. At the
time I speak of he was already locally
known as a colorist of no mean capacity
and a man of genius. I had heard his name,
but only in connection with that of a dear
friend and schoolmate of my own, a beautiful,
golden-haired little creature, with a
voice as delightful as her person, whom he
was said to be following everywhere she
went. They never met until after our marriage,
which preceded her own.</p>

<p>I went one afternoon with my brother to
see his pictures and his studio. The latter
struck me as the most untidy room I had
ever entered. I remember his rushing to
throw things behind a large screen. I was
not used to paintings. Such as I had seen
had seemed to me mere daubs to which any
good engraving would be altogether preferable.
But on that afternoon there was a
large unfinished landscape on the easel,
which even to my unpractised eye conveyed
the promise of beauty. It was a commission,
painted for a Mr. Thomas of Albany,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
if I do not mistake. There were two great
boulders lifting their heads out of a shallow
foreground brook, and one day, much
later, when I was there, he painted his own
initials on one of them and mine on the
other, but—as was always his habit when he
remembered to sign his pictures at all—in
tints differing so slightly from that of the
surface on which he inscribed them as to be
scarcely distinguishable from it.</p>

<p>We were married in my father’s house
during the first year of the Civil War, on
the twenty-fifth of June, 1861, and went
off the same day to Twin Lakes, Connecticut.
I still have the first sketch in oils
which he made out-of-doors that season: a
barley-field, meadow land in the middle
distance, gray-green trees beyond. Two or
three brown boulders, others merely penciled
in, lie on the left of the foreground.
The delicate heads of grain are swaying in
a light breeze. Perhaps he did not do much
in the way of visible work that summer. At
all events, I do not now recall any. But in
some subsequent winter he embodied his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
recollections of the place and time in a delightful
landscape. All his life long, I think,
his results were arrived at more by means of
a slow, only half deliberate absorption when
out-of-doors than by a wilful effort to record
them at the time. Yet the one exception
to that statement which I distinctly
recall is a very great one: the Westchester
Hills, which is thought by many to be his
most perfect landscape. It was painted
entirely <i lang="fr">en plein air</i>, and many a day I sat
close by, reading aloud or knitting while it
was in progress. He never got so much as
an offer for it, nor was it until more than
two years after his death that a purchaser
was found sufficiently venturesome to end
a long hesitation by paying $1,000 to obtain
it. He was presently rewarded for his
temerity, I am happy to say, for when he
put it up at auction a few months later,
it brought him $4,750. The second purchaser
was still more fortunate, reselling it
for $5,300.</p>

<p>Neither of us ever revisited Twin Lakes.
Later in the season we went to the farmhouse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
of Mr. Thaddeus Dewey, near Fort
Ann, N. Y., where we remained until late
in the autumn.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">My</span> husband retained his Albany studio
until the winter of 1862-63, when he went
to New York and for some months painted
in the studio of Mr. James Smillie. It
could hardly have been earlier than the winter
of 1864-65 that after many efforts he
succeeded in finding an empty studio in the
Tenth Street Studio Building—a little,
skylighted room on the top corridor which
he occupied continuously until he resigned
it before sailing for England the second
time in the fall of 1881. His forty-fifth
birthday came while he was on shipboard.
I followed him to London in the succeeding
June.</p>

<p>His nearest neighbors in the Studio
Building for many years were Sanford R.
Gifford, Richard Hubbard, C. C. Griswold,
and J. G. Brown. Jervis McEntee and his
charming wife were on the corridor next
below; so was Julian Scott. Eastman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Johnson and Launt Thompson were on the
ground floor. I think that John La Farge
must have come a little later. At any rate,
I do not remember him before the winter
of 1867-68. Failing, as often happened, to
find my husband in his own studio, I went
one day to that of Mr. La Farge on the
same corridor in search of him. He was
not there either, but I still retain a very
distinct recollection of Mr. La Farge, face
and characteristic attitude of doubtful welcome
for intruders quickly changing as he
divined my identity, asked me to enter, and
so began a friendship still unbroken. Of
course, Homer had talked a good deal to
me about him. Certain questions which had
been pressing on my mind with increasing
persistence ever since my father’s death in
1866, very speedily found expression in a
sort of personal catechism concerning his
hereditary faith which he, perhaps, may
likewise recall.</p>

<p>We were fairly prosperous in those early
years, or might have been if we had been
constituted differently. “There is much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
virtue in If.” Homer’s landscapes were
often commissioned, and seldom remained
long on his easel in any case after they were
finished. But it was never possible to count
on any definite term as that of their probable
completion. He was a man of many
moods, and that one of them in which he
could paint and be satisfied after a fashion
with what he painted, was the most irregular
and uncertain of them all. He did not
possess his genius but was possessed by it.
His fallow periods were many. When they
passed away, the first sign that seeds had
begun to sprout again was often the entire
scraping out of a landscape that to others
had seemed to need only the final touches.
I asked him once in later years, at a time
when there was every need for exertion
were it possible, why he did not paint. It
was in 1881. “I cannot paint,” said he.
“I do not know where the impulse comes
from, nor why it stays away. All I know
is that when it comes I can do nothing else
but paint; when it goes I can do nothing
but dawdle.” That was absolutely true. It
was also very inconvenient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>But in that earlier period with which I
am still concerned, his pictures for years
brought him an income which averaged between
two and three thousand dollars,
sometimes more than that. It was war-time
and after. Prices were high for everything.
Money came at irregular intervals,
often so prolonged that, when it did come, it
had to be chiefly employed in the process he
once described as “mopping up debts;” a
kind of industry to which he found me
persistently addicted. Neither of us took
as much thought for the morrow as perhaps
we might have done had not the morrows
themselves seemed so uncertain a quantity.
Life used to present itself to me at that
time as a narrow path leading between
precipices, across turbulent brooks, over
stones that were slippery as well as sharp,
and whose end was nowhere in sight. In
fact, it never did become visible until, turning
at some unexpected angle, our cul-de-sac
would prove to have had a hidden outlet
after all. Perhaps this was why our frequently
recurring difficulties troubled us
more and taught us less than they might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
have done under different circumstances.
In the complex of life we ourselves were
circumstances. Once, in later years, he
casually remarked that I had never given
him a chance to get tired of me, because
he never knew what I would do next. Can
any one give what one has not got?</p>

</div>

<p>Meantime, we found life entertaining as
well as perplexing and difficult. Our little
boys were healthy, intelligent and good-tempered.
Homer’s work, when he could
once settle down to it, was always able to
divert his mind from every other preoccupation.
I had been writing book reviews
occasionally ever since the early spring of
1861 for the “Leader,” to which paper an
article of mine concerning Mrs. Rebecca
Harding Davis’s first novel had been sent
under a pseudonym by the brother I have
already referred to, who was a friend of
that eccentric genius, Henry Clapp. Later
on, I wrote once in a while for the “Round
Table,” and, after some date in 1866, when
Auerbach’s “On the Heights” was sent
me from the “Nation” editorial rooms for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
review, pretty steadily for that periodical.
Our friends were interesting to both of us.
If Homer ever “talked shop,” at least I
never heard him, and the men whose company
he instinctively sought were never
painters; or, since I must make an exception
in the case of John La Farge, they
were never merely that. He had a great
capacity for love, and the two men whom
he loved best were critics in the large sense:
John Richard Dennett, from the first time
they met until his untimely death in 1874;
and William C. Brownell from that period,
or perhaps before it, until the end.</p>

<p>Painting was his own sole means of adequate
expression. Perhaps I ought not to
say that. I may not be an adequate judge,
and certainly I have heard great things
about his reputation as a talker at the
Century Club. But to me, from first to
last, he never talked about impersonal subjects—perhaps
because he could not consider
anything that affected me in a purely
impersonal light. I always read aloud to
him a great deal, but the books and topics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
which interested me most after 1870 never
interested him at all. Until then we had
both been turning our intellectual searchlights
in every conceivable intellectual
direction. At that period mine steadied on
its proper centre and veered no more. But
to the very end I continued to read to him
whatever he desired to hear.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, even though he was too
many-sided not to find issue in more than
one direction, his pictures are the only permanent
result of his imperative need for
self-expression. He always detested what
he called literary pictures—pictures, that
is, that told or tried to tell a story. And
yet I think it true to say that if he is supreme
as a colorist it is largely because
color was to him an instrument, not an
end. He used it as a poet uses words. He
made it reflect not so much what is obvious
in nature as that duplex image into which
external nature fused itself with him, who
was also a part of nature. To me, this is
what individualizes his pictures. I think it
impossible to mistake them. When he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
in England the second time, I went to the
art rooms of Mr. Lanthier, whom I had
authorized to obtain from William Schaus
a landscape I had never seen, and which
had been for some months tucked away in
an upper room inaccessible to visitors. I,
at least, had been refused a sight of it when
I went to the Schaus gallery for that purpose.
The attendant told me they did not
exhibit American pictures. Lanthier obtained
possession of it, and when I saw it
I remarked that, as usual, it was unsigned.
“Unsigned!” protested he. “It is signed
from the top of the canvas to the bottom.
No one in the world could have painted it
but Homer Martin.” He sold it a few
days later to Mr. Sidney de Kay, whose
family, I believe, still possesses it.</p>

<p>Homer went abroad for the first time in
1876, in company with the late Dr. Jacob
S. Mosher, an Albany friend of both of us
since before our marriage, and at that
period quarantine physician of the port of
New York. They went to France and Holland,
perhaps to Belgium, as well as to England.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
How far they penetrated into France
I do not remember, but I do recall—though
when Mr. Charles de Kay wrote to ask the
question some three years since I had forgotten—that
they visited Barbizon and
probably some of the painters whose classic
ground it was, and that Homer made some
pencilings both there and at Saint-Cloud.
They were absent for some considerable
time, and it was at this period that he made
acquaintance with the late James McNeill
Whistler.</p>

<p>He sailed for England the second time in
October, 1881, and I joined him in London
early in the next July. On the “glorious
Fourth” we visited Mr. Whistler’s studio,
where Homer had occasionally painted. I
think it must have been there that he
painted, late in the previous autumn, a delightful
Newport landscape which was
bought at the Artist Fund sale of that season
by Mr. Lanthier for Mr. Charles de
Kay. Whistler’s beautiful portrait of his
mother—which I afterward saw in Paris
at the Salon—was on the easel, and it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the only one of his pictures which I distinctly
recollect. There were some “nocturnes”
on the walls, and they were doubtless
worth remembering. But I never went
there again, and on this occasion my
attention was riveted by the artist and his
surroundings, alike spectacular and bizarre,
the man grotesque as a caricature in attitude
and aspect, the rooms all pale blue and
lemon-yellow, even to the many vases and
the flowers therein contained. He said a
good many things, not one of which was I
able to recall, so lost was I in contemplation
of the general oddity of him and his chosen
environment. “What did you think of
him?” asked Homer after we came away.
“Why didn’t you talk? You never said a
thing.” “I was afraid to open my lips,”
said I, “lest I should involuntarily tell him
to shake that feather out of his hair. He
must have had his head buried in a pillow
before we went in.” “I wish you had!”
said he with a laugh. “That is Jimmy’s
feather. He delights in having it noticed.”
I had observed that he bowed profoundly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
on our introduction and so brought it into
staring evidence; but I could scarcely believe,
even on testimony, that the premeditated
effect was produced by a quite unpremeditated
lock of gray hair.</p>

</div>

<p>The especial occasion for this second
visit to England was the making of some
drawings illustrative of places mentioned
in the novels of Thackeray and George
Eliot. He had been there for some months
and they were hardly more than begun, but
after I came he worked at them pretty
steadily. It was an undertaking which he
did not at all enjoy, but which circumstances
had made imperative. When he
first told me of it in the previous summer,
he made it evident that he thought such a
commission derogatory to his dignity as a
painter. Whether it was that his pictures
were selling less readily, or because the
painting mood came with less imperative
frequency, I do not know, but he was
unusually despondent. The idea of the
voyage was pleasant in itself. One of
his never fulfilled longings was to cross<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the ocean in a sailing vessel. His Artist
Fund picture was nearly due and could
be painted on the other side; he thought
the price of the drawings would pay all
his other expenses. And when an unexpected
stroke of good fortune made it
possible for me to join him, his sky cleared
up. I do not remember whether the English
drawings were successful; I do know
that they were tardy in reaching the New
York office of The Century Company, for
whose magazine they had been destined,
and that when, in the ensuing year, he sent
the same publishers a set of Villerville
drawings, accompanied by a sketch he had
suggested my writing about that delightful
haunt of painters, Mr. Gilder wrote me,
after some delay, that they had been much
interested in my article, but that their art
department was not satisfied with the drawings.
It was subsequently published in the
“Catholic World,” unaccompanied by the
illustrations, that magazine not then having
begun to produce any.</p>

<p>In October of that year, the completion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
of the last drawing coincided with the arrival
in London of an old New York friend,
the late Mr. Bryant Godwin, and an invitation
to spend some weeks in Normandy with
the family of another, W. J. Hennessy, the
well-known artist and illustrator. There
was no further reason for delay in England,
and the three of us crossed the Channel
one night by the Southampton boat. I
have never forgotten my first sight of the
French shore next morning. “I don’t
wonder now at Rousseau’s color,” I said to
Homer; “how could he help it?”</p>

<p>It had been our intention to return to
New York after a brief visit with the Hennessys,
who had been living for years in a
picturesque and pleasant way at Pennedepie,
an agricultural hamlet on the road between
Honfleur and Trouville, where they
occupied a roomy and quaintly furnished
old manor just opposite the village church.
But we found the place, the people, and the
neighboring views alike delightful, and
when news arrived, early in our stay, of a
considerable sum to his credit which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
been lying for some months uncalled for at
the American Exchange, London, where it
had been sent to his first address by Mr.
James Stillman, Homer decided on remaining
in Normandy. To have returned
to New York just then would have been a
distinct loss to both of us in many ways.
I look back on the time we spent in Villerville
as the most tranquil and satisfactory
period of our life together.</p>

<p>That little fishing village, dominated by
the tower of a church erected when the eleventh
century was young, in thanksgiving
because the foreboded end of the world had
not come in the year 1000, lies about midway
between Honfleur and Trouville, at an
easy walk from Pennedepie. Equidistant
from either place stands the ivy-grown
church of Criquebœuf, beloved of artists,
and made by Homer the theme of one of his
best pictures. In the same grassy enclosure
on the right of the pond into which this old
church dips its foot, he found two more
delightful subjects. One of them is embodied
on one of his last canvases, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
“Normandy Farm,” now owned, I believe,
by Mr. Bloomingdale of New York. It
was bought in the first place by Mr. W. T.
Evans, a week or so before my husband’s
death. The other, a view of a deserted
manor, showing dimly through a veil of
ghostly trees, which Mrs. Hennessy declared
ought to be called “The Haunted
House,” was finished in New York after
his return for an early friend, Dr. D. M.
Stimson, to whom for many years he had
been greatly attached. I think it was exhibited
at the Chicago World’s Fair.</p>

<p>Villerville had for years been thronged
in summer and fall by painters, French,
English, and American; perhaps it is so
still. Guillemet had been there for twenty
consecutive seasons; Duez had built himself
a house and studio with a Norman tower.
Stanley Reinhart came both summers while
we were there, with that most sweet wife of
his and their pretty little children. The
Forbes-Robertsons had a little villa for a
while,—the parents, that is, and Miss
Frances, then a girl of sixteen; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
actor son must have spent some considerable
part of his vacation with them, for
I recall a rather animated discussion we
had one night, pacing up and down the
<i lang="fr">estacade</i> in the moonlight, when he declaimed
in so ardent a fashion about the
intrinsic and extrinsic glories of England,
that a mere sense of equilibrium made the
interjection of a “What about Ireland?
What about India?” seem to me inevitable.
“Oh! unjust, if you insist,” said he. “But
I am an Englishman—Scotch as a matter
of fact, I suppose. And you must admit
that a man is bound to stand up for his
country, right or wrong.” It is a sentiment
I have never been able to understand.
Some of us, I suppose, are born cosmopolitans,
or else look forward to “an abiding
city wherein dwelleth justice,” since not
even patriotism can insist that it has a local
abiding place here.</p>

<p>And that reminds me of another incident
belonging to the winter time, when, as there
was not an English-speaking soul in the
entire neighborhood except ourselves, our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
landlord one day brought me in despair a
lady whose vernacular it was, accompanied
by a French <i lang="fr">bonne</i> and two little children
as apple-faced and ruddy as Polly Toodles’
babies. She explained that she was the
wife of a major in the English army, and
had but just returned with him from India;
also, that while there she had read such a
glowing description of the beauties of Villerville
in a copy of “The Queen,” that
she had determined to examine them for
herself. I did what I could for her in the
way of finding a furnished apartment, and
before they had removed to it, went one
morning to return her call at one of the
hotels. I found her and the major at a
late breakfast, with the English newspapers
lying about. The period antedated
Mr. Joseph Chamberlain’s change of his
political coat, the Irish question was well to
the front, and my new acquaintances spoke
English with one of the most sonorous
brogues that had ever greeted my ear.
Here was a case in which my own sympathies
and the presumable ones of my audience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
seemed naturally to invite a moderate
expression of views on a current topic.
Dead silence fell for a moment after I had
stopped speaking. Then the major said
with an accent that positively projected:
“Excuse me, but I am English: that is to
say, I am Irish, <em>but of the landlord class</em>!”
It was simply a matter of the point of view.</p>

<p>It was this question of the seasons, I
think, which chiefly necessitated my learning
the language which was afterward of so
much use to both of us up to the very end.
It also necessitated a more incessant companionship
than at any period was ever possible
in the city of the Century Club. It was
easy to pick up French enough to carry on
such intercourse as was absolutely necessary
with the people about us, but my serious
study of it was undertaken in the first
place in order that I might continue to
read aloud to Homer in the evenings
after the available supply of English novels
and periodicals had been exhausted. I
began with About’s “Roi des Montagnes,”
my method being to read a sentence to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
accustom his ear and my tongue to the unfamiliar
sounds, and forthwith to translate
it literally. Of course, I had teachers, one
of whom had taught this, her native language,
in a London private school, while
a second was at the time professor of English
in the College of Honfleur. Curious
English it must have been! But he was
praiseworthily anxious to increase his own
knowledge as well as mine. But the best
one of the three was a delightful woman,
Mademoiselle Lemonnier, the village postmistress,
who did not know a word of
English although her mother had been an
Englishwoman. She was very well read
and intelligent as well as companionable
and kindly. I had applied to her, when my
first instructress found it impossible to
come any longer, to find me another. We
already knew each other pretty well, and
when she said, “If you will let me teach
you <em>for love</em>, I will do it myself, but if you
insist on paying, I will inquire for some one
else,” it was simply a new version of Hobson’s
choice. I could not have done better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
in any case. When Homer went abroad
for the last time, he made a point of crossing
the Channel to visit Mademoiselle
Lemonnier. Slender as were their means
of communication, they had managed to
understand and sympathize with each other
very completely, a strong sense of humor
on either side helping greatly to that consummation.</p>

<p>We lived in Villerville for nineteen
months. An excellent studio with two adjacent
rooms had been arranged for us
before our arrival, and we lunched and
dined at Madame Cornu’s hotel, providing
our breakfast in our own quarters. A
quaint old English priest whom I knew in
London, and who had to the full the hereditary
prejudice against “Johnny Crapaud,”
had warned me not merely of what
he believed to be the prevalent Jansenism
which would prevent so frequent an approach
to the sacraments as I had been
accustomed to, but against the cheating, the
conscienceless thievery to which he assured
me we would be subjected on all sides. “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
would not spend a farthing in France!”
said he. Well, in Paris, perhaps, though
I had no personal experience of it even
there. But in Villerville, and afterward
in Honfleur, there was absolutely no exception
to the perfect cordiality, absolute
trust, and gentle politeness which greeted
us on all sides. I have never met anything
like it elsewhere save in the parish of the
Paulist Fathers in New York. I speak
from what may be called exhaustive knowledge,
since there was a period, before we
left the former place, when we were out of
money for so long that when at last we
were able to settle Madame Cornu’s bill
it amounted to the considerable sum of two
thousand francs. I had asked her some
time previously if she were not in need of
it, but only to receive the smiling answer:
“When Madame pleases. We are neither
of us robbers.” So in Honfleur, where,
after we had been domiciled for a month or
so, and had found our fresh bread and rolls
on the kitchen-window ledge every morning,
I went to the baker to inquire for and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
settle his account. “But, Madame,” objected
the fresh-cheeked young woman in
charge, “we have kept no account. Does
not Madame know how much it is herself?”
“Why, yes,” said I; “you have brought so
much for so many days at such a price.”
“<i lang="fr">C’est ça</i>” she smiled. “Whatever Madame
says.” And this, again, reminds me
of Madame Cornu and her remarkable
bill. There had been a price set in the first
place of so much a day for our two meals,
which were always abundant and well-cooked.
I knew the dates and was ready
with the exact sum. But when my tally
was placed beside her bill there was a discrepancy
arising from the fact that Homer
would sometimes be absent from the midday
meal by reason of a sketching excursion
or something of the sort, and she was
never notified beforehand. Yet on every
such occasion a deduction had been scrupulously
made. Such an experience never
befell us elsewhere.</p>

<p>To Homer also Villerville was as delightful
as any place could be while lacking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
that social intercourse with men of brains
and cultivation which was always his chief
pleasure and relaxation. Years afterward,
Mr. Brownell said one evening when we
were all dining together in those pleasant
apartments of theirs on Fifty-sixth Street,
that the three weeks which he and his wife
had spent there with us seemed to him more
like his idea of heaven than anything he
remembered. And he asked me whether I
would not like to live it all over again. In
retrospect, yes; as I have just been proving.
But, were it possible in reality? O
no! Never have I seen a day that has
tempted me to say to it: “Stay, thou art
fair!”</p>

</div>

<p>Our sojourn in Villerville was a particularly
important one for both of us, but in
different ways. For him it was a period of
absorption rather than of production, while,
on that very account, exactly the reverse
process went on in me. I have already said
it was at his suggestion that I accompanied
his Villerville drawings with an article
which, Mr. Brownell afterward wrote me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
was like “a Martin landscape put into
words.” Homer perhaps thought so himself,
for he had already said: “I see that
you can paint with words. I wonder if you
can set people in action. Why not try?”
Whereupon I made a character sketch
which Mr. Alden, of “Harper’s Magazine,”
declined because “it was too
painful,” but which the then editor of
“Lippincott’s”—I think his name was
Kirk—found too short, and wrote me that
if I would lengthen it out so that it should
bear less resemblance to a truncated cone,
he would be glad to avail himself of it.
Whereupon I recalled it, fished up my heroine
out of an earthquake on the island of
Capri which I had allowed to swallow her,
but whom I now unearthed, none the worse
except in the matter of a broken wrist,—I
think it was a wrist,—and in a month or so
received a very fair-sized check for the tale
of her experiences.</p>

<p>The same sort of exterior pressure, not
any interior need of expression, was what
led to the production of a tale which ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
for eighteen months as a serial in the
“Catholic World” under the title of
“Katharine,” and during that period provided
for our necessary expenditures.
Henry Holt republished it with a new
name which he himself suggested. I liked
the first one better, but it made too little
difference to me to make it worth while to
adhere to my own views. Mr. Kirk, by the
way, had also renamed my sketch: that
seems to be a privilege with literary sponsors,
the literary parent not being present.
Almost an entire chapter was also eliminated
from the book, because the reader,
whose name I never knew, objected to it
on the ground that it showed too plainly
that “Mrs. Martin really believed” that a
certain tenet of her faith was absolutely
true.</p>

<p>I began a second story on the heels of
this one, but when it had run to some thirty
thousand words, Homer objected to it as
certain to split upon the same dogmatic
rock as its predecessor, and I laid it aside
for a third one which attained the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
proportions and pleased every one who then
or thereafter read it better than either of
its predecessors. But it had the misfortune
of not specially interesting me; and yet
there was a baby in it with the second sight,
who bade fair to develop into something
“mystic, wonderful,” in course of time, if
not interfered with. Meantime, the imperative
need for production on my part
having ended, I put the unfinished manuscript
in the fire some three years ago. The
second one I completed after our return
to New York, and it was published under
the title of “John Van Alstyne’s Factory,”
in the “Catholic World.”</p>

<p>To Homer our life in France was chiefly
seed-time. There germinated his “Low
Tide at Villerville,” the “Honfleur Lights,”
the “Criquebœuf Church,” the “Normandy
Trees,” the “Normandy Farm,”
the “Sun Worshipers,” and the landscape
known in the Metropolitan Gallery of
New York, where it now hangs, as a
“View on the Seine,”—which, in strictness,
it is not,—but for which his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
title was “The Harp of the Winds.”
I had asked him what he meant to call
it, and, with his characteristic aversion
to putting his deeper sentiments into
words, he answered that he supposed it
would seem too sentimental to call it by the
name I have just given, but that was what
it meant to him, for he had been thinking
of music all the while he was painting it.
And this reminds me of a commission given
him by a music-lover among his friends
during our early days in New York to
“paint a Beethoven symphony” for him.
He did it, too, and to the utmost satisfaction
of its possessor.</p>

</div>

<p>He used to carry about with him in those
days a pocket sketch-book in which he noted
his impressions in water-color. Mr. Brownell
must remember it, and so, I think, must
Mr. Russell Sturgis, for, being at our rooms
during my husband’s last sojourn on the
other side of the Atlantic, when he was
known to be afflicted with an incurable malady,
he said to me that if Homer’s things
were ever put up for sale, he would like to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
become the purchaser of this book. My
husband never got over his chagrin when
it became evident that it must have fallen
a prey to some unscrupulous packer of our
household goods at the time when he concluded
to follow me to St. Paul, in June,
1893. He had a suspicion that it might
have found its way to a pawnbroker, and
never gave up hoping for its ultimate recovery.
It had in it some delightful miniature
bits of character and color.</p>

<p>It was in Villerville also that he began
the “Sand Dunes on Lake Ontario,” now
hanging in the Metropolitan Museum, New
York, with the intention of sending it to
the Salon. But before it was completed he
got into one of those hobbles which were
not uncommon in his experience, when the
more he tried to hurry the less he was in
reality accomplishing. It was in no condition
to be seen when the last day for
sending came, as we both agreed, yet he
sent it. Naturally enough, it was rejected.
I think that result surprised him less than
it momentarily annoyed him. He put the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
canvas aside and for months never touched
it. But one day during the next season,
while he was painting on it, a French
landscapist and his wife came to call
upon us. I forget his name. He studied
it in silence for a long time. Then
turning to me, he said: “Your husband’s
work reminds me strongly of that of Pointelin.
He must send this canvas to the next
Salon.” “It has been there once,” said
I, “and the jury rejected it,” adding, because
of his evident surprise, “It was not
then in its present condition.” “Nevertheless,”
he replied, “I cannot understand
a French jury rejecting such a picture in
any state in which Mr. Martin would have
sent it in at all.”</p>

<p>I do not remember just why we removed
from Villerville. Perhaps because Homer
was able to obtain in Honfleur a roomy and
well-lighted studio apart from our dwelling-place,
an arrangement which he always
preferred. The little city from which William
the Norman set out on his conquering
expedition in 1066 had not the picturesque<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
charm of the village we left, but possessed
compensating features in the way of English
and American neighbors. Our whole
sojourn in France was, in fact, delightful,
and perhaps even more so to me than to
my husband. Through my mother there
was a good deal of French blood in my
veins, and in its ancestral environment it
throbbed with a rhythmic atavism unknown
elsewhere to my pulses.</p>

<p>I think that notwithstanding the excellent
lighting arrangements of his studio,
my husband did not complete much work
in Honfleur. “The Mussel Gatherers,” to
me one of the most impressive of his later
canvases, was finished there, and though
I do not recall another for the Artist Fund
Sale, I suppose there must have been one.
A never-completed studio interior with a
portrait of me, and reproductions in miniature
of the studies hanging on the walls;
still another small portrait, a number of
panels, one of which, “Wild Cherry
Trees,” was in the Clarke Sale in 1897, and
various water-colors belong likewise to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
period. Meanwhile his note-books were
filling up with material for future use.</p>

<p>I sailed for New York at the end of
August, 1886, and Homer, who had remained
to finish some of the things I have
just named, followed me three months
later, arriving December 12th of that year.
In the following spring he secured one of
the studios in Fifty-fifth Street, having
previously utilized for that purpose a room
with a north light in an apartment we had
in Sixty-third Street. In his more convenient
quarters he painted a few great
pictures, among them the “Low Tide at
Villerville,” the “Sun Worshipers,” and
still another, the title of which I never
knew, and which I never saw until much
later, when going one day with the late Miss
a’Becket to the Eden Musée,—I think to
see something of her own in an exhibition
then in progress, of paintings belonging to
private owners,—this great canvas faced
me on the line of the opposite wall, and
startled me into the exclamation: “That
must be one of Homer’s!” It was full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
light and color. The land on the left sloped
gradually down nearly to the middle of the
foreground, and the wonderful sheet of
water behind and beyond it that fairly rippled
out of the frame, was dazzling. What
he called it I do not know. To each other
we never gave his landscapes any name, nor
did he to any one else unless a purchaser required
a title, or there was question of a
catalogue. I think, however, that this canvas
may be one which was completed in
January, 1889, while I was in Toledo, and
which was bought almost as soon as finished
by Mr. Thomas B. Clarke. If so, it
changed hands very soon, and was possibly
taken away from New York. Homer
wrote me at the time about the sale. From
all I could learn of the Memorial Exhibition
at the Century Club in the spring of
1897—an exhibition which, to my lasting
regret, closed just before I was able to
reach New York—this picture was not included
in it.</p>

<p>His last studio in New York—occupied
from 1890 until he went to St. Paul in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
June, 1893—was in a house belonging to
the Paulist Fathers and adjoining their
Convent in Fifty-ninth Street. There he
painted the “Normandy Trees,” the
“Haunted House” I have already referred
to as belonging to Dr. D. M. Stimson,
the “Honfleur Lights” now owned by
the Century Club, and began the “Criquebœuf
Church,” afterward completed in
St. Paul. In that house I first observed
that his eyesight, always imperfect, was becoming
still more dim. Never till then had
I known him to ask any one to trace an outline
for him. He thought, moreover, that
some serious internal trouble threatened
him, and consulted both an oculist and a
physician. In the early summer of 1892,
believing that an ocean voyage would benefit
him, he availed himself of the opportunity
afforded by the sale to the Century
Club of the “Honfleur Lights” and
sailed for the last time to England. He
spent a very considerable part of his absence
at Bournemouth, where resided the
family of Mr. George Chalmers, friendship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
with whom must, I think, have been
coeval with his entire life in New York, and
lasted, on the part of the survivor, far beyond
it. Concerning this visit, Mr. Chalmers
wrote me a few years later, in reply to
my request that he should tell me about it:
“I do not feel that I can do Homer the
justice he deserves. Certainly that visit
greatly endeared him to me and to my wife,
and even to our Harold, who was then a
little mite, but who remembers him well. I
wish I could remember some of Homer’s
talk, always so charming, on our various
outings during that happy time—especially
about pictures, a subject with which he was
eminently so familiar. Two visits to the
National Gallery in London I recall in a
general sort of way, to be sure. I remember
how stirred he was as we stood before
the two Turners in the National Gallery,
presented by the artist on condition that
they should be placed next to the Claudes.
Homer regarded Turner’s challenging
comparison with the great Frenchman as
the sheerest audacity, and called attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
to the fussiness and labored work of the
Turners compared with the ease and serene
dignity and splendor of the Claudes.”</p>

<p>Curiously enough, Mr. Chalmers arrived
in New York from London the next day
after my own arrival from St. Paul, in
April, 1897, and took what I am sure could
not have been altogether agreeable pains in
order to render me a very important service.</p>

<p>During this last absence of my husband
from America, I spent a part of my own vacation
in Ottawa, and while there received a
letter in which he asked me to write to the
oculist who had examined him—I think it
was Dr. Bull—and find out from him precisely
what was the condition of his eyes. I
did so, and received the painful verdict that
the optic nerve of one of them was dead,
while the other was partially clouded by a
cataract. I mention these facts in order that
my readers may get an adequate conception
of the enormous difficulties under
which his latest paintings were begun and
finished. Among these is the autumnal
known as “The Adirondacks,” exhibited at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the Century Club Memorial Exhibition,
and bought shortly afterward by Mr. Untermyer
at the sale of Mr. T. B. Clarke’s
collection. Looking at it when he was giving
his final touches, I said to him:
“Homer, if you never paint another
stroke, you will go out in a blaze of glory!”
“I have learned to paint, at last,” he
answered. “If I were quite blind now, and
knew just where the colors were on my
palette, I could express myself.” Another
belonging to this period is the “View on the
Seine” already referred to, and which in an
earlier stage was, to my mind, still more
beautiful than it is at present. In its primitive
condition—and, indeed, from the moment
when it was first charcoaled on the canvas,
the trees so grouped that they suggested
by their very contour the Harp to which he
was inwardly listening—it was supremely
elegant. Elegance is still its characteristic
feature, but I wish he had left it as I saw it
first. “The trees were about four hundred
feet high!” he objected, when I told him
so, and I did not then, and do not now, see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the force of the objection. It was a thing
of beauty, anyhow, and who but a pedant
measures those except by the optical illusion
and spiritual impression they produce?</p>

<p>It was I who went first to St. Paul,
where our elder son resided, hoping to recover
by means of a long rest from the
fatigue entailed by incessant mental labor.
I had been editing, reviewing, translating,
finishing a novel, besides keeping house,
and began to feel as if my own mainspring
were liable to snap at any moment. This
was at the end of December, 1892. I
went, intending to return, and to continue
the writing of book reviews during my
absence. But in February I broke down
completely, gave up all work and all expectation
of resuming it in New York. In the
following June, Homer resigned his studio
and followed me, stopping on the way to
see the Chicago Exposition, where several
of his paintings were on view.</p>

<p>In St. Paul he had for a while a very
good studio in one of the life insurance
buildings, and while there completed several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
pictures, among them that of the
“Criquebœuf Church,” selling it, almost as
soon as it reached New York, to Mr. William
T. Evans. This building was sold,
soon afterward, and converted to uses which
made it impossible as a studio.</p>

<p>If my memory serves me correctly, it was
in the spring of 1894 that the Century Club
had a reunion of more than ordinary importance.
The special date and occasion I do
not recall, but I know that Homer’s presence
was so urgently desired by some of his
friends that he then paid his last visit to
New York, and to the place and associates
in it which had given him most satisfaction.
He was absent some six weeks, possibly
more, and I have since been told that
when he left, his physical condition was
such that his friends not merely gave up
hope of seeing him again, but expected
speedy tidings of his death. But the end
was not so near. It was to be preceded by
such a conquest of mind over matter, of
sheer will over propensities both inherited
and acquired, of triumphant performance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
in the face of physical obstacles apparently
insurmountable as is altogether unique in
my experience. Such efforts are never
made, I take it, except under the stimulus
of hope, and even that sheet-anchor often
fails when the soul is pusillanimous. But
Homer Martin was no coward. Moreover,
he had always been his own severest critic.
Mr. Montgomery Schuyler has quoted him
as saying in earlier years when the hangmen
exalted him “above the line” in exhibitions,
and buyers accepted that verdict as
conclusive: “If I could only do it, they
would see it fast enough.” Mr. Schuyler
adds: “But this was more modest than exact.
Even after he had attained the capacity
to ‘do it,’ to make canvas palpitate with
light and color, as the visitors to the Memorial
Exhibition know, the picture-buyers
of twenty years ago still failed to ‘see it.’”</p>

</div>

<p>But, at the period of his life with which
I am now concerned, he was not only conscious
that he had attained full mastery of
his own power of artistic expression by
means of color, but he had reason to believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
that an opportunity had been afforded him
to make that mastery triumphantly evident.
Although his faith turned out to be ill-founded,
yet his belief to the contrary was
sufficient to make him rise at once to his full
strength and shake off without apparent
effort whatever other shackles had hitherto
confined him. He was like nothing so much
as blind Samson after his hair had grown,
and he carried off the gates of old habits
and flung them aside as easily as if he had
never felt their weight. In the late spring
of that year he went away alone to a quiet
farm, taking with him the canvases on
which “The Adirondacks,” the “Seine
View,” and the “Normandy Farm” were
already charcoaled, and set to work at
their development and completion. From
time to time he would come into the city,
his step alert and his physical improvement
so apparent in every way, that
my apprehension that his health was already
shattered irreparably gave way to
confidence that years of life and successful
achievement were still before him. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
for him, I think he never fully believed that
the doctors were right in considering his
bodily condition hopeless until a short time
before his death. He had always looked
confidently forward to such length of days
as both of his parents and others of his more
remote forbears had attained. “I never
thought,” he said to me one night, a week
or two before his death, “that I was shortening
my life in this way.” As to his
blindness, it never became entire, and having
been accustomed from the beginning to
defective vision while yet absorbing his
material through the eye and appealing to
it in his production, he had, in a measure
bewildering to hear of and barely credible
to us who beheld it in its final efforts,
learned to rely almost entirely on his inward
vision and the hand which responded as it
were instinctively to its impulse and suggestion.</p>

<p>The pictures I have named went to New
York in the late autumn of 1895, and were
at once acknowledged with hearty words of
praise and a preliminary check. My husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
was back at home by this time, and,
full of vigor and the anticipation of assured
success, had begun three or four other
landscapes. Only one of these was
ever completed, but that was so present
to his imagination, and his steady hand
moved in such obedience to his will, that
it took visible shape almost without an
effort. He had begun making plans for
the future and seemed to have renewed his
youth. And then, when the year was
nearly ended, his hopes were shattered by
the tidings that the pictures were found to
be unsalable, and had been, or were to be,
transferred to other hands which might or
might not be more successful in finding
purchasers for them.</p>

<p>This was the end, so far as further work
was concerned. My Samson fell once more
into the hands of the Philistines, and this
time not to rise again.</p>

</div>

<p>Over those final days, I have not the
heart to linger. In all ways, they were
inexpressibly painful. In August of the
following year, a growth in his throat made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
its appearance. Although it never caused
him intense physical anguish until a few
days before his death, when it seemed to
have made its way to the brain, it caused
him great discomfort. So long as hope remained
that it was not malignant and
might be removed, he felt and expressed an
irritation which, under the precise circumstances,
was only natural. But when, late
in October, about the time of his sixtieth
birthday, the specialist who was attending
him pronounced it cancerous, his mood
changed. Certain thoughts, certain memories,
certain injustices of which he had felt
himself the victim, would still move him to
indignation when the recollection of them
recurred, but he bore his physical trials with
wonderful and unalterable patience. A
Unitarian clergyman in the neighborhood
began calling on him in the early winter
and contributed much to his entertainment
in some of my unavoidable absences. But,
as Christmas was approaching, my husband
asked me to request the Reverend Doctor
Shields, now Professor of Psychology in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the Catholic University at Washington,
D. C., to pay him a visit. Said he: “L⸺ is
a good fellow; he thinks just as I do about
the tariff and the civil service, and he likes
good books. But, what all that has to do
with his profession, considered as a profession,
I do not clearly see.” Therefore I
preferred his request to Dr. Shields, who
might reasonably have refused it, as he was
not doing parish duty but employed in
laboratory work at the Ecclesiastical Seminary
in St. Paul. He came, nevertheless, a
number of times, paying his last visit on the
Saturday evening before Homer died. And
then, before leaving, he said to me: “There
is not the ghost of a hope that your husband
will do just exactly what you wish him to
do. And, for my part, I am content to
leave him in the hands of God just as he is.
He is absolutely honest. If he could take
another step forward, he would do it.”
And, on his part, Homer said to me,
“Father Shields has the clearest mind of
any man I ever met. I wish I had known
him three years ago. But now my head is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
in such anguish that I can no longer keep
three or four threads of argument in my
mind at the same time.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">One</span> day in Honfleur, Homer broke a
protracted silence by saying, “I hope that
I shall die before you do.” To which I
answered, “I hope so too.” “You think
that you could get along better without me
than I could without you?” he asked, and
I said, “I know I could.” And now, two
days before he died, he said, “I am glad
that I am going first”; adding a few more
words which it pleases me to remember,
but which I shall not repeat. And again
I told him that I was glad also. Later
still, he asked me what I meant to do when
he was gone, and when I said I hoped to
enter a convent, he replied, “That is just
what I supposed. Well, it is a beautiful
life.”</p>

paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official

  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
